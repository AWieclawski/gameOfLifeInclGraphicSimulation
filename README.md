# Conway's Game of Life 
From given a 2D array and a number of generations it computes each timestep of Conway's Game of Life.

The rules of the game are:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.
3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.

For illustration purposes, 0 and 1 are represented as ░░ and ▓▓ blocks.
